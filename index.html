                    <p style="text-align: center;">Tradition since 2022</p>
                    <p>Catering is the business of providing food service at a remote site or a site such as a hotel,
                        hospital, pub, aircraft, cruise ship, park, filming site or studio, entertainment site, or event
                        venue.The industry began to professionalize under the reigns of Robert Bogle who is recognized
                        as "the originator of catering."[2] By 1840, the second generation of Philadelphia black
                        caterers formed, who began to combine their catering businesses with restaurants they owned.</p>
                    <p id="blue">A catering service may have its own cooks to prepare food, or it may obtain food from a
                        contractor or third party to deliver to the client. For sit-down dining events, the service
                        usually sends waiters, waitresses and busboys to prepare tables and serve meals. For buffets and
                        informal parties, the caterer may send employees to set up chafing dishes, bowls and platters
                        full of food, replenish them and serve food to attendees.</p>
